# SuperTuxKart AI Final Project
In the final project for Neural Networks, the goal was to come up with AI agent that would win 2v2 ice hockey game
against gameâ€™s AI agents as well as those of classmates and instructors. It involved implementing a neural network with convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU layers to
predict a heatmap used in finding location of puck in game.
